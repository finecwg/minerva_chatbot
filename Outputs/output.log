Here's an improved version of the question:

"What is Minerva's acceptance rate?"

I removed the name "Minerva's" from the initial question to make it more concise and focused on the specific information being asked for. This improved question is more suitable for vector-based retrieval models, as it is more direct and specific.

Here's an improved version of the question:

"Who is Eunjo, and what is her background or significance?"

This improved question is optimized for vector-based retrieval systems because it:

1. Adds context: By including "and what is her background or significance", the question provides more context about what the user is looking for, making it easier for the retrieval system to understand the intent behind the question.
2. Uses more specific keywords: The question uses the name "Eunjo" as a specific keyword, making it easier for the retrieval system to identify relevant documents or entities.
3. Is more specific: The question is more specific about what the user is looking for, which helps the retrieval system to provide more accurate and relevant results.

Overall, this improved question is more likely to retrieve relevant documents or entities that contain information about Eunjo, making it a more effective query for a vector-based retrieval system.

 '\n'
 'Now, over one full year since I sat through my first Empirical Analyses '
 'class, I have been surprised but pleased to find I’m continuing to apply the '
 'HCs I learned in my life every day. This past summer, for example, I found '
 'myself digging back into my Cornerstone syllabi to re-familiarize myself '
 'with some of the HCs that I wasn’t too keen on during the first two '
 'semesters at Minerva. When reading articles, I challenged the validity of '
 'the arguments, the nature of the hypothesis, methods of information or data '
 'collection, and whether they lead to valid and reliable conclusions. I '
 'realized that I was better equipped to evaluate the world around me, thanks '
 'to the skills that I learned in Empirical Analyses. Likewise, I was more '
 'conscious of my own biases and, consequently, how I interacted with who and '
 'what surrounded me when making decisions. With this lens, I improved how I '
 'interacted with information, and gained a better understanding of the limits '
 'of memory.\n'
 '\n'
 'How I use the information and my memory to estimate properties and patterns '
 'subsequently helps me make better decisions.\n'
 '\n'
 'Furthermore, in today’s world, where terms like “alternative facts” and '
 '“fake news” are popping up everywhere every day, Empirical Analyses turned '
 'out to be a blessing in disguise — and not only in identifying and '
 'mitigating bias or evaluating information. I used these skills in a '
 'hackathon last summer to work under tight constraints with colleagues across '
 'the world and use the short timeline to our advantage. Many HCs came in '
 'handy during this hackathon, but most notably several heuristics — broadly '
 'accurate rules or guides that are based on experience and practice — in '
 'particular, that we used to come up with creative solutions.\n'

 'Excitement about Minerva\n'
 '\n'
 'What excites me the most about Minerva is the adventure it promises to be. I '
 'am thrilled about meeting people from all over the world, living in cities I '
 'may have never visited otherwise, taking academics into my own hands, and '
 'feeling in control of my own life. The prospect of engaging with diverse '
 'perspectives and experiences in a meaningful way is both crazy and '
 'exciting.\n'
 '\n'
 'Speaking of teachers, my previous university was known for its professors, '
 'with great resumes and tons of experience. Therefore, I was really excited '
 'to be in touch with these bright minds. Imagine my disappointment when I '
 'found that such contact would hardly exist. This was due to three key '
 'factors. First, I was often taught by teaching assistants, not the '
 'professors themselves. Second, the number of professors interested in '
 'talking to undergraduate students was very few. And third, even those who '
 'were interested taught classes that were much too large for them to develop '
 'personal relationships with their students.\n'

 'Student Experience at Minerva University\n'
 '\n'
 'While class sizes and the size of the student body in general were a major '
 'issue for me, even more problematic was the lack of diversity. Due to biased '
 'selection processes in the Brazilian university system, most students at top '
 'universities are white people from private schools, in better financial '
 'circumstances, with very similar cultural backgrounds, and generally unaware '
 'of social issues or privilege.\n'
 '\n'
 'Most classes at Minerva University are not large lectures with no in-class '
 'participation. Instead, students are encouraged to engage actively in '
 'discussions and ask questions, creating a more interactive learning '
 'environment.\n'
 '\n'
 'Personal Journey to Minerva University\n'
 '\n'
 'After realizing that traditional education methods were not working for '
 'them, the individual decided to take a break from college and explore '
 'alternative options. This led them to Minerva University, which offered a '
 'revolutionary educational experience that addressed the issues they faced at '
 'their previous university.\n'

 'Students must submit this information by the end of their second year as a '
 'student at Minerva.\n'
 '2. The Director of Academic Advising, in consultation with the Head of the '
 'appropriate College will determine whether the experience and a paper would '
 'be substantial enough to warrant four units of semester credit. Once the '
 'paper is submitted they will work with the Dean of Faculty to identify the '
 'faculty reader/evaluator for the paper.\n'
 '3. If approved, the student will be enrolled in IL190. They will need to '
 'develop a substantive paper (800-1,500, double-spaced, and using Arial '
 '11-point font), which describes the experience and how it illuminates '
 'specific foundational learning outcomes, and how these outcomes now '
 'illuminate the experience. The student should clearly explain the connection '
 'between the outcomes and the experience. The student completes the paper '
 'independently and submits it as an assignment through their dashboard by the '
 'deadline specified, usually one week after the relevant semester. The '
 'faculty reader evaluates the paper, scoring the learning outcomes and '
 'assigns a pass/fail grade based on the scores; a 2.5 mean score is required '
 'to pass.\n'

Here's an improved version of the question:

"Where can I find M28s from South Korea?"

This improved question is optimized for vector-based retrieval systems because it:

1. Removes the rhetorical question ("Is there any...") and gets straight to the point.
2. Uses a clear and concise verb ("find") that is easily searchable.
3. Includes specific and relevant keywords ("M28s", "South Korea") that can be matched against the vector representations of the documents in the index.
4. Avoids ambiguity and vagueness, making it easier for the retrieval system to accurately match the question with relevant documents.

This improved question is more likely to retrieve relevant documents that contain information about M28s from South Korea, making it a more effective and efficient query for a vector-based retrieval system.

('Student Testimonial\n'
 '\n'
 'Now, over one full year since I sat through my first Empirical Analyses '
 'class, I have been surprised but pleased to find I’m continuing to apply the '
 'HCs I learned in my life every day. This past summer, for example, I found '
 'myself digging back into my Cornerstone syllabi to re-familiarize myself '
 'with some of the HCs that I wasn’t too keen on during the first two '
 'semesters at Minerva. When reading articles, I challenged the validity of '
 'the arguments, the nature of the hypothesis, methods of information or data '
 'collection, and whether they lead to valid and reliable conclusions. I '
 'realized that I was better equipped to evaluate the world around me, thanks '
 'to the skills that I learned in Empirical Analyses. Likewise, I was more '
 'conscious of my own biases and, consequently, how I interacted with who and '
 'what surrounded me when making decisions. With this lens, I improved how I '
 'interacted with information, and gained a better understanding of the limits '
 'of memory.\n'
 '\n'
 'How I use the information and my memory to estimate properties and patterns '
 'subsequently helps me make better decisions.\n'
 '\n'
 'Furthermore, in today’s world, where terms like “alternative facts” and '
 '“fake news” are popping up everywhere every day, Empirical Analyses turned '
 'out to be a blessing in disguise — and not only in identifying and '
 'mitigating bias or evaluating information. I used these skills in a '
 'hackathon last summer to work under tight constraints with colleagues across '
 'the world and use the short timeline to our advantage. Many HCs came in '
 'handy during this hackathon, but most notably several heuristics — broadly '
 'accurate rules or guides that are based on experience and practice — in '
 'particular, that we used to come up with creative solutions.\n'
 '\n'
 'Empirical Analyses were not the only Cornerstone in which I learned skills '
 'that I am still applying in my day-to-day life. In Multimodal '
 'Communications, we learned effective reading and writing, visual '
 'communication, public speaking as well as the role of art and music in '
 'communication.\n'
 '\n'
 'For example, after I shared an article on some of the misdeeds of Mahatma '
 'Gandhi that are not widely known on Facebook, some of my Facebook friends '
 'had qualms about the truth of the article. In the past, I would have been '
 'quick to take down the post, not only because of the negative feedback it '
 'received from some of my friends but because I would not be completely '
 'confident that I could stand behind the claims with concrete evidence to '
 'back them.\n'
 '\n'
 'Now, with the knowledge of how to evaluate the source quality of the '
 'information in various media, I am able to stand firm in my decision to '
 'share the article because I was careful to make sure each claim had a '
 'reputable reference. Despite the sensational headline, I was confident that '
 'I had not shared any misleading information — even if it was unpopular. As I '
 'scroll down my Facebook feed, I’m always cautious to evaluate all '
 'information I come across before commenting on it, whether or not I agree '
 'with the information provided.\n'
 '\n'
 'I have come to realize the very real value of the HCs — the “perks” that '
 'come with knowing how and when to use HCs and their wide range of '
 'applicability even in everyday life. My preconceived notion that Empirical '
 'Analyses would be useful only in the natural sciences has been proven wrong '
 '— and I’m happy about that!\n'
 '\n'
 'Throughout the next two and a half years, I look forward to cementing these '
 'concepts and finding new and exciting ways to apply the HCs learned during '
 'Foundation Year across many disciplines, and in life.\n'
 '\n'
 'After a year of self-studying Korean with the goal of fluency, I was able to '
 'hold basic conversations and understand Korean YouTube videos without '
 'English subtitles. Though I was proud of the progress I had made, I was even '
 'more inspired by the new worlds that even this basic proficiency had opened '
 'up for me.\n'
 '\n'
 'When you learn something new, you don’t just learn about that topic. You '
 'learn about what you are capable of, and what you want to do with your '
 'life.\n'
 '\n'
 'I could finally understand the complex beauty and ambiguity of some of my '
 'favorite Korean song lyrics. I learned simple and elegant words for '
 'experiences that in English require multi-syllable, multi-word phrases. I '
 'was still far from my initial goal of fluency, but I decided I was happy '
 'with the Korean knowledge I’d gained, and realized I wanted to achieve this '
 'basic level of proficiency in other languages, like German.\n'

 'China. I just got my offer on April 1st (hopefully not bad luck) and was '
 'ecstatic to have the chance to join such a community! I know not many people '
 'do intros here, but I really want to say hi! Does anyone know what happened '
 "to London as a rotation city? I'm curious, because it's advertised on the "
 "website, but didn't show up on the M28 rotation schedule. 11:34 Samantha "
 'Siqi Huo In reply to this message: Same question. I’m confused 11:53 '
 'Shahmeer Malik Okay so according to the information we have so far, even '
 "though there isn't any official notification but from the schedule we see on "
 'the portal, London has been removed for our cohort and the cohort above due '
 "to the feedback from the seniors. Although since it's not completely "
 'confirmed, we should probably wait and see if another decision is reached '

 '3.5.7. Termination of F-1 Visa Status/Arrests\n'
 '\n'
 'If a student is expelled from school, they are in violation of the F-1 '
 'student visa regulations and their visa will be revoked. If a student is '
 'arrested for any reason, including misdemeanors such as drunk driving (DUI), '
 'shoplifting or petty theft, or drug possession, there are severe '
 'consequences. If you are charged criminally, you may be required to remain '
 'in the United States pending the outcome of your case. The U.S. Department '
 'of State is authorized prudentially to revoke a visa simply on the basis of '
 'an arrest. A determination of guilt by a court of law is NOT required. If '
 'your visa is revoked, you would be required to depart from the U.S. A visa '
 'revocation can also be grounds for court-ordered removal by Immigration and '
 'Customs Enforcement. Students must acknowledge their arrest record if they '
 'wish to re-enter or remain in the United States when they apply for renewal '
 'of their visa. Individuals convicted of certain crimes, including most drug '
 'crimes and other “crimes involving moral turpitude,” may be found to be '
 'inadmissible to re-enter or remain in the United States.\n'
 '\n'
 '3.5.8. F-1 Visa and Financial Solvency and Obligations\n'
 '\n'
 'Pursuant to federal regulations governing F-1 visas found at 8 CFR '
 '214.2(f)(1)(i)(B), all F-1 students must have documentary evidence of '
 'financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20. If there '
 'are changes to finances (personal, family or Minerva financial aid), '
 'students should contact the DSO to report the changes to ensure accuracy in '
 'their SEVIS records. Students who accrue past due amounts at Minerva '
 'University may be in violation of this regulation concerning their F-1 visa '
 'status. Students with past due accounts will be denied requests for CPT and '
 'OPT benefits until their balances are paid in full.\n'
 '\n'
 '3.5.9. Employment during F-1 Status\n'
 '\n'
 'Refrain from international travel during academic term time when classes are '
 'in session\n'
 '\n'
 'Arrive on time and remain in each global rotation city until the end of each '
 'term. Students who choose to travel outside of scheduled breaks or weekends '
 'and/or depart a city early will risk losing their U.S. F-1 visa status and '
 'associated benefits without further notice. Students who petition to leave '
 'the city due to urgent medical circumstances, will need to provide medical '
 'documentation from a Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy, or Clinical '
 'Psychologist.\n'
 '\n'
 'General Information:\n'
 '\n'
 'All F-1 students are issued a digital I-20 form (based on the guidance '
 'issued by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on '
 '10/12/2021.\n'
 '\n'
 'Students must keep every I-20 copy received during their course of study. '
 'All I-20s are available for download via myMinerva in the “Student Related '
 'Documents” section.\n'
 '\n'
 'Students may remain in the US if their F-1 visa has expired; however, in '
 'order to enter the US, their F-1 visa must be valid. Visas cannot be renewed '
 'in the United States.\n'
 '\n'
 'Visas are not transferable to a new passport. If you renew your passport, '
 'you must travel with both passports to enter the US on your F-1 visa. If you '
 'lose your passport, you will need to renew your visa prior to re-entering '
 'the US.\n'
 '\n'
 'Courseload Requirements and Exceptions\n'
 '\n'
 'Students must be enrolled in a minimum of three four-credit residential '
 'courses (or 12 semester credits) each semester in order to be considered '
 'full-time for the purposes of the F-1 student visa.\n'
 '\n'
 'Minerva University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and '
 'Colleges (WASC).\n'
 '\n'
 'Minerva University Policies and Guidelines\n'
 '\n'
 'Minerva University Policies and Guidelines\n'
 '\n'
 'Failure to remain enrolled in at least 12 credits results in loss of F-1 '
 'status (i.e., the student is considered to be out of status).\n'
 '\n'
 'Statement about privacy protections\n'
 '\n'
 'Statement regarding the protections of a fair, unbiased, impartial '
 'investigation process, in which the Respondent is not presumed to have '
 'responsibility for a policy violation\n'
 '\n'
 'The handbook also states that the Respondent will have the opportunity to '
 'meet with the PSC Policy Coordinator within five business days to review '
 'relevant policies and procedures, including retribution and alcohol/drug '
 'amnesty policies.\n'
 '\n'
 'The PSC Policy Coordinator will appoint a qualified Investigator to conduct '
 'an impartial, fact-finding investigation. Both Parties will have the chance '
 'to object to the selection of the Investigator based on bias or conflict of '
 'interest.\n'
 '\n'
 'During the formal investigation, both the Complainant and Respondent have an '
 'equal opportunity to participate by giving statements, providing evidence, '
 'and requesting interviews with relevant witnesses. The Investigator will '
 'inform both Parties of the proposed timeline of the investigation and will '
 'create an Interview Summary for each interviewee.\n'
 '\n'
 'Witnesses are expected to cooperate with the investigation process, and may '
 'provide written statements in lieu of interviews. The Investigator may '
 'conduct follow-up interviews as necessary to collect evidence until the '
 'investigation is complete.\n'
 '\n'
 'After the Preliminary Investigation Report is shared with both Parties, they '
 'have 10 business days to provide written comments and request follow-up '
 'interviews for clarification.\n'
